	Added support for "use" field for using extra modules inside the
	thread when tie()ing the variable.

	Added documentation for the TIEHANDLE implementation.

	Fixed up the default TIEHANDLE implementation.  Should now work
	except for readline() in list context: because the context is not
	(yet) passed to the thread correctly, reading lines from a file
	in list context doesn't work.

	Added BEGIN section to Thread::Tie, causing the default thread
	to be started during compilation.  This can make the thread as
	lightweight as possible, especially if it is the first module used.

	Added some intelligence to Thread::Tie::Thread's _freeze and _thaw
	so that they will not use Storable unless it is really needed.  This
	should be a performance boost for the simple cases.

	Removed mention of being truly shared because Arthur Bergman pointed
	out that the current tie() implementation _always_ saves the values
	in the (thread local) SV.  Although this has nothing to do with
	shared variables, it _does_ cause the values to actually be copied
	into thread local space everytime they are fetched.

	First version of Thread::Tie.
