README for Thread::Tie

Tie variables into a thread of their own.  Creates alternative to the current
shared variables implementation.  Also allows shared variables to be tied to
the module of your choice (inside the thread they reside in).

                         *** A note of CAUTION ***

This module only functions on Perl versions 5.8.0 and later.  And then
only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It is of no use with
any version of Perl before 5.8.0 or without threads enabled.
